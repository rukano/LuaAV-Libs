Libraries for easy coding in LuaAV
===================================

This library is for my personal use. If you like it, you can use it.
I won't concentrate much on programming elegance or so... the modules create a lot of globals and lots of stuff could be optimized. But anyway, this is what I use to make animations in LuaAV
